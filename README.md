# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis

Welcome to my Electric Vehicle Analysis dashboard showcase, where I've embarked on an exciting journey through the evolution of electric vehicles from 2010 to 2024. This dashboard compiles a comprehensive exploration of electric vehicle trends, performance metrics, and insightful analysis using Power BI.

Problem Statement:
The objective of this dashboard is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle landscape from 2010 onwards, encompassing both Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs). By examining key metrics such as total vehicles, average electric range, and vehicle distribution by model year, state, make, and model, this dashboard aims to offer valuable insights into the market size, technological advancements, adoption trends, and consumer preferences in the electric vehicle industry.
